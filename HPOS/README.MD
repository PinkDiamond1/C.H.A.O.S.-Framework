# HPoS 

HPoS will be implemented in two phases, HPoS-P and HPoS-R.

In the first phase, HPoS-P, a PBTF-based consensus mechanism that uses permissioned voting system and majority rules of delegation will be implemented. It also supports Byzantine Fault Tolerance and supervisory nodes participation; this means better access control, higher performance, and lower energy consumption. HPoS-P can effectively support Dimension to provide a vigorous and stable blockchain network service.

In the second phase, the upgraded hybrid consensus design, HPoS-R, will be implemented based on Robust Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RBFT), which further improves the robustness and simplicity of the system.
