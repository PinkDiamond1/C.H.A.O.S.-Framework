# Dynamic Node  

In the existing blockchain platforms, if there's a new node joining, the old node has to wait and re-modify after the downtime, then the network will take effect after the network reboot. This process is unacceptable for most business scenarios; thus, how to ensure high availability, scalability, and performance is the greatest challenge to commercial blockchain networks.

The quantity adjustment of nodes in Dimension network is implemented by the Dynamic Node mechanism. The Dynamic Node is a validating mechanism based on structuring on-chain authorized delegation and mutual validating vote system among consensus nodes.

The quantity adjustment proposal requires two-thirds votes from existing nodes. The Dimension network will then maintain the entire accounting task after the new adjustment. This dynamic adjustment not only improves the flexibility of the blockchain system, but it also ensures smoother operation of the network, which also reduces costs and avoids potential risks.
