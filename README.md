# C.H.A.O.S.

- Dimension's proposed cross-consensus operating system, C.H.A.O.S., which stands for Cross-Hybrid Automated Operating System.

- Includes three core modules: 
  - HPoS 
  - Dynamic Node  
  - ConsensusX.  

- C.H.A.O.S. combines the advantages of different consensus algorithms, and it has the dynamic function to adjust the size of nodes, which can easily adapt the rapid changes for different user networks and allows multiple consensuses algorithms switch in seconds.
